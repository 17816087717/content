**Baseline** identifies the availability of web platform features across popular browsers, including APIs, CSS properties, and JavaScript syntax. Baseline describes web features as being either widely available or newly available. Features that do not meet the Baseline criteria are said to have limited availability.

Baseline considers support in the following browsers:

- Apple Safari (iOS)
- Apple Safari (macOS)
- Google Chrome (Android)
- Google Chrome (desktop)
- Microsoft Edge (desktop)
- Mozilla Firefox (Android)
- Mozilla Firefox (desktop)

Baseline is a summary guide to browser support, but does address feature accessibility, usability, performance, security, or other concerns.
